### **Analysis Conducted**:  
✅ **Price Distribution**:  
- Analyzed the distribution of vehicle prices, revealing that mid-range cars dominate consumer choices, while luxury vehicles command premium pricing.  

✅ **Regression Analysis**:  
- Found a **strong positive correlation** between **engine horsepower** and MSRP, indicating that consumers associate high engine power with greater value.  

✅ **Market Segmentation**:  
- SUVs and trucks are growing in popularity, while sedans and coupes are gradually losing demand in specific demographics.  

✅ **Fuel Efficiency Impact**:  
- Cars with higher **fuel efficiency** (MPG) attract more demand, especially in urban markets where fuel costs and environmental concerns are critical.  

✅ **Feature Correlation**:  
- A **correlation heatmap** was used to visualize relationships between numerical features (e.g., engine size, MPG, MSRP).
